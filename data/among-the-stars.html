<h2>Turn Overview</h2>
<ol>
  <li>All players select a card from their hand and pass the rest (Left Years 1 &amp; 3, Right Years 2 &amp; 4) to the next player.</li>
  <li>All selected cards are revealed simultaneously. The player who currently has the most VP announces which action they’re taking. In case of a tie, the player with the most Credits goes first. If there is still a tie, the order among them is chosen randomly.</li>
</ol>
