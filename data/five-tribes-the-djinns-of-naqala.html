<h1>Five Tribes</h1>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In 3- and 4-player games, each player takes 8 Camels and 1 Turn marker of the color of his choice (The extra pink and blue Camels and Turn markers are not used).</li>
  <li>In 2-player games, one player takes all 11 Pink Camels and 2 Turn markers, and the other all 11 Blue Camels and 2 Turn markers.</li>
  <li>Each player also gets 50 Gold Coins (9 coins worth “5” each + 5 worth “1” each) Players should keep their coins hidden.</li>
  <li>Mix all 30 Tiles and place them randomly face up, to form a rectangle of 5 x 6 Tiles: This is the Sultanate</li>
  <li>Mix all 90 wooden Meeples in the bag, then grab and drop them in random sets of 3 on each Tile.</li>
  <li>Place the Bid Order &amp; Turn Order Tracks next to the Sultanate. Take the players’ Turn markers and randomly place them on the Bid Order track. This will determine in which order the players initially bid for position on the Turn Order Track</li>
  <li>Shuffle all Resource cards to form a draw pile face down, then draw the top 9 cards and lay them face up in a row, next to the draw pile.</li>
  <li>Shuffle the Djinns’ cards and set them face down in a draw pile, then draw the top 3 and lay them face up next to the draw pile.</li>
  <li>Place the Palm Trees, Palaces and all remaining Gold Coins in a bank within easy reach of the players</li>
