h1 Dominant Species

h2 Setup

h3.subheader The Board
p Place the board – face up! – in the center of the table

ol(type="A")

	h3.subheader The Animals

	li Have each player choose the animal he would like to play. Give each player the animal display matching their choice. Alternately, you can assign one animal display to each player at random.
	li In reverse Initiative order – that is, insects first, then arachnids, then amphibians, etc. – players place their animal’s square initiative marker into the boxes underneath the “Initiative” tag.

	h3.subheader The Tiles

	li Place one large tile belonging to each of the seven non-tundra terrain types into their assigned positions in the center of the hex grid. Place a tundra tile atop the sea tile.
	li Place the eleven remaining tundra tiles in a face up stack on the “Glaciation Tiles” section of the board.
	li Flip the remaining 24 large tiles face down and shuffle them up in any manner desired. Create three (face down) stacks of 8 large tiles each. Place these stacks on the three #[strong “Wanderlust Tiles”] sections of the board. Turn the top-most tile of each of these stacks face up.

	h3.subheader The Cards

	li Set the Survival Card off to the side for now.
	li Remove the Ice Age card from the deck of Dominance Cards. Shuffle the remaining 25 Dominance Cards together. Place the Ice Age card face down next to the board. Put the shuffled Dominance Cards face down atop this card to form a draw pile.
	li Draw the top five cards of this draw pile and place them face up in the “Available Dominance Cards” section of the game board.

	h3.subheader The Elements

	li Take two of each of the six element types and place them on the tiles of earth as indicated on the board.
	li Gather up the rest of the elements and form a draw pool by placing them into the cloth bag provided.
	li Randomly draw 4 elements from the bag—place them on the board into the four squares allotted for them (the ones with the “leaf” symbol) next to the #[strong “Adaptation”] tag.
	li Draw 4 more elements at random to fill the leaf squares next to the #[strong “Abundance”] tag,
	li and another 4 random elements for the leaf squares next to the #[strong “Wanderlust”] tag.

	h3.subheader The Species

	li From amongst the wooden pieces, each player chooses a color to represent his animal. From their colored pieces, each player gathers up the ten cones (to be used as dominance markers) as well as the following number of cylinders (to be used as action pawns) and cubes (to form their species gene pool):
		ul
			li #[strong 6-player game] – 3 cylinders and 35 cubes
			li #[strong 5-player game] – 4 cylinders and 40 cubes
			li #[strong 4-player game] – 5 cylinders and 45 cubes
			li #[strong 3-player game] – 6 cylinders and 50 cubes
			li #[strong 2-player game] – 7 cylinders and 55 cubes (all cubes)
	li From each player’s gathered cubes, take one to use as a VP marker: place these on the “0” space of the Victory Point Track.
	li Each player then takes species from his gene pool and places them on certain starting tile as follows:
		ul
			li #[strong Insects] – 2 on savannah, 1 on wetland and desert
			li #[strong Arachnids] –  2 on jungle, 1 on forest and wetland
			li #[strong Amphibians] –  2 on wetland, 1 on jungle and savannah
			li #[strong Birds] – 2 on forest, 1 on mountain and jungle
			li #[strong Reptiles] –  2 on desert, 1 on savannah and mountain
			li #[strong Mammals] – 2 on mountain, 1 on desert and forest
	li.panel With fewer than six players, ignore placement instructions for any animal not being played. Note that each animal begins the game Dominating its centrally-occupied tile

h2 Sequence of Play

p Dominant Species is played in a series of turns in which all players take part more or less simultaneously. Each turn is divided into three Phases:
	ul
		li
			strong Planning Phase
		li
			strong Execution Phase
		li
			strong Reset Phase

p During the #[strong Planning Phase], players will take turns placing their available action pawns (APs) into the “eyeball” spaces of the action display that dominates the right half of the board. Each AP will indicate an action to be taken by that player during the following Execution Phase. Each action space can hold a maximum of one AP so it’s “first come, first served”.
p During the #[strong Execution Phase] – which begins once all available APs have been placed for the turn – APs are removed from the action display in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. Each time an AP is removed in this fashion, the owning player performs the action indicated in that section’s title bar (such as “Glaciation” or “Migration”).
p During the #[strong Reset Phase] some species may go extinct and one player may be able to score VPs via the Survival Card. Then if the game hasn’t ended yet the action display is reset for the following turn.
p Play continues from turn to turn in this manner until the game ends and final scoring occurs.

h2 Game End

p When the game ends via the Ice Age card, finish the remainder of the Domination actions, if any, then perform Extinction and score the Survival Card as normal. Then remove all Domination markers from earth and score each and every tile of earth one last time: Domination is ignored during final scoring—that is, animals gain VPs only, not any Dominance Cards that may be remaining.
p Once final scoring is complete, the player in control of the animal with the highest VP total wins the game. In case of a tie for highest, the tied animal closest to the top of the food chain wins the game for its controller.
