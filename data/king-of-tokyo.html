<h1>King of Tokyo</h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Players roll and reroll dice to allow their monster to attack, heal, gain energy to buy cards, and gain Victory Points (VPs).  The first player to reach 20 VPs or to have the last monster standing wins.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Each player chooses a monster, takes its figure and board, and sets its Life Points (hearts) to 10 and Victory Points (blue stars) to 0.</li>
  <li>Place the Tokyo board in the center of the table.</li>
  <li>Shuffle the deck and deal the top three cards face up next to the Tokyo board.</li>
  <li>Randomly determine the first player.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Game Play</h2>
<p>Start with the first player and continue clockwise until game end.</p>
<h3>Turn Order/Phases</h3>
<h5>1 – Rolling and Rerolling the Dice</h5>
<p>Roll all six black dice.  Then you may reroll any or all of the dice, twice.  Dice kept on the first reroll can be kept again or rerolled on the second reroll. When a card says “reroll” it means an additional reroll of as many dice as you would like, unless the card says otherwise.</p>
<h5>2 – Resolving the Dice</h5>
<p>The 1, 2, and 3 results can score you Victory Points (VPs).  For each set of three of the same number, you gain that number of VPs (e.g., three 2’s are worth a total of 2 VPs).  Each additional roll of that number beyond a set of three is worth 1 more VP (e.g., five 2’s = 4 VPs).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each Energy result (green lightning bolt) lets you take one Energy Cube.  Energy Cubes can be saved from turn to turn.</li>
  <li>Each Heal result (heart) lets your monster regain one Life Point.  Your monster’s Life cannot go above 10 (without buying the Even Bigger card).</li>
  <li>Each Attack result (claw) deals one damage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If you are in Tokyo, you deal damage to all monsters that are not in Tokyo.</li>
  <li>If you are outside Tokyo, you deal damage to all monsters that are in Tokyo.</li>
  <li>Your monster is not considered to be “attacking” unless it has at least one Attack result on the dice, so a card that increases your damage has no effect if you did not roll at least one Attack result.</li>
  <li>If your monster’s attack ends up doing no damage (e.g., due to Camouflage), then it is no longer considered to be an attack for cards such as Poison Spit or Herbivore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a card that deals damage when purchased (like Gas Refinery) is not considered to be an attack.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If your monster loses its last Life Point, you are out of the game.</li>
  <li>If Tokyo is unoccupied, the first monster to have at least one Attack result during this step deals no damage and then must move into the Tokyo space and take control.</li>
  <li>If you are attacked while in Tokyo, you may yield to the attacking monster after taking any damage.  Your monster leaves Tokyo and the attacking monster takes your place and takes control.  This occurs even if the monster leaving took no damage from the attack.</li>
  <li>If you are eliminated by an attack (not by a Discard card that deals damage) while in Tokyo, the attacking monster takes your place and takes control.</li>
</ul>
<h5>3 – Buying Cards</h5>
<ul>
  <li>You may purchase any of the three face up cards by paying the Energy cost.</li>
  <li>Purchased cards are immediately replaced from the top of the deck.</li>
  <li>Youli  may also pay 2 Energy to sweep (discard) the face up cards and replace them with new cards.</li>
  <li>You may make any number of purchases and sweeps in any desired order.</li>
  <li>Cards labeled Discard are immediately resolved and then discarded.</li>
  <li>Cards labeled Keep are kept face up in front of you.</li>
  <li>Cards that use dice results only apply to your final results from step 2.</li>
  <li>Counters are available for certain cards (3 Smoke Cloud, 1 Mimic, 12 Shrink Ray, and 12 Poison Spit).</li>
</ul>
<h5>4 – End of Your Turn</h5>
<p>Resolve any card effects that occur in this step in any order you choose and then pass the dice to the left.</p>
<p>
  Tokyo: When you take control of Tokyo, you gain 1 VP.
  When you start your turn in Tokyo, you gain 2 VP.
  While in Tokyo, you cannot use the Heal results on your dice to heal your monster.
</p>
<h5>Tokyo Bay (Advanced Rule)</h5>
<p>When playing with 5 or 6 players, the Tokyo Bay space can also be used.</p>
<p>
  All references to Tokyo also apply to Tokyo Bay (i.e., monsters in Tokyo or in Tokyo Bay are considered to be “in Tokyo”).
  After a monster that is not in Tokyo attacks, it must occupy Tokyo or Tokyo Bay if either is unoccupied or yielded.  If both spaces are empty, the first choice is Tokyo.
  If Tokyo Bay is unoccupied but Tokyo is, your attack damages the monster in Tokyo and then you either take control of Tokyo if the monster yields or you take control of Tokyo Bay.
  If your monster attacks when both Tokyo and Tokyo Bay are occupied, both attacked monsters are damaged and both can yield.  If both yield, you must occupy Tokyo.
  If elimination brings the number of players to below 5, Tokyo Bay can no longer be occupied.  The monster in Tokyo Bay must leave Tokyo.
  
</p>
<h5>Winning the Game</h5>
<p>
  The game ends when a player reaches 20 VPs or has the last monster standing.
  If you reach 20 VP but are eliminated on the same turn due to cards, you cannot claim victory.
  It is possible for all monsters to be eliminated at once.  In that case, everyone loses.

<h5>Card FAQ:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Armor Plating – if it reduces an attack to 0, a card like Acid Attack has no effect.  Armor Plating works on each source of damage during a turn.</li>
  <li>Drop From High Altitude – has no effect if you are currently in Tokyo Bay.</li>
  <li>Even Bigger – if this card is lost, you lose 2 Life Points.</li>
  <li>Fire Breathing – if your neighbor is a target of your attack, he takes one extra damage.</li>
  <li>Freeze Time – each extra turn is a complete normal turn and you can score multiple extra turns in a row.</li>
  <li>Frenzy – when purchased, you immediately go to step 1 of the next turn.</li>
  <li>Friend of Children – does not combine with Metamorph or Monster Batteries.</li>
  <li>It Has A Child! – you keep your Energy when you respawn.</li>
  <li>
    Mimic – if the copied card leaves play, take the mimic counter back.  It can be placed on a new card at the start of your turn for 1 Energy.
    The card is mimicked as if you just bought it in terms of counters, regardless of the number of counters on the mimicked card.
  </li>
  <li>Opportunist – if this card is being copied by the Mimic card, the first player to the left of the active player with one of these cards gets the first opportunity to use it.</li>
  <li>Parasitic Tentacles – this card is only usable during your own turn.  Any counters on the purchased card remain.</li>
  <li>Poison Quills – the damage dealt is not an additional attack.  It is combined with any Attack results.</li>
  <li>Poison Spit – the counters stay in play and in effect even if this card leaves play.</li>
  <li>Shrink Ray – the counters stay in play and in effect even if this card leaves play.</li>
  <li>Wings – you may pay the energy whenever you want in the turn (before taking damage of course).</li>
</ul>
